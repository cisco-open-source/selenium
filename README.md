# Selenium (branch with QtWebDriver)

Selenium is an umbrella project for various tools and libraries that
enable automation of web browsers.  Amongst other things it provides
the support infrastructure for the [W3C WebDriver
specification](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webdriver/raw-file/tip/webdriver-spec.html),
that lets you write interchangable code for all major web browsers.

This fork of Selenium includes Java language bindings for [QtWebDriver]
(https://github.com/cisco-open-source/qtwebdriver), see [QtWebDriverService]
(https://github.com/cisco-open-source/selenium/blob/master/java/client/src/org/openqa/selenium/qtwebkit/QtWebDriverService.java) class.
It is possible to test QWidget, QWebView, QQuick1 (Qt4),
QQuick2 (Qt5) or hybrid applications using this driver. QtWebDriver features
are covered by series tests included in this repository. Information
how to run them is available below.

The project is made possible by volunteer contributors who have put in
thousands of hours of their own time, and made the source code freely
available under the [Apache 2.0
license](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/COPYING).

## Repositories

The authorative master repository of selenium is at
https://code.google.com/p/selenium/.  It also mirrored on GitHub,
which may be found at https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium.

## Pull requests

We accept pull requests from GitHub.  When making the pull request,
please indicate that you have filled in the
[CLA](https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?hl=en_US&formkey=dFFjXzBzM1VwekFlOWFWMjFFRjJMRFE6MQ#gid=0),
otherwise it will take longer for us land your patch.

Merging pull requests cannot be done with the GitHub GUI.  The email
sent from GitHub can be used on your local repository or you can use
the ["power git
checkout"](http://maven.apache.org/developers/conventions/git.html#power-git_checkout).
We also like to keep a linear history on the master branch, and we
will normally squash and rebase your patch.  This means merges are
disallowed, as they make reverting reverts a pain and generally make
it more difficult to read our change lists.

## Building

Selenium uses a custom build system called
[crazyfun](http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/CrazyFunBuild)
available on all fine platforms (Linux, Mac, Windows).  We are in the
process of replacing this with
[buck](http://facebook.github.io/buck/), so don't be alarmed if you
see some directories carrying multiple build directive files.
crazyfun's build files are called *build.desc*, while buck's are named
simply *BUCK*.

To build Selenium, in the same directory as this file, do…

```sh
./go
```

The order of building modules is determined by the `go` system itself.
If you want to build an individual module (assuming all dependent
modules have previously been build) try something like:

```sh
./go //javascript/atoms:test:run
```

In this case, `javascript/atoms` is the module directory, and `test` is a target
in that directory's `build.desc` file.

As you see *build targets* scroll past in the log, you may want to run
them individually.  `go` can run them individually, by target name as
long as `:run` is appended (see above).

To list all available targets, you can append `-T` as an option:

```sh
./go -T
```

### Buck

Although the plan is to return to a vanilla build of Buck as soon as
possible, we currently use a fork, hosted at
https://github.com/shs96c/buck To build using Buck, first clone that
repo and build using ant. Then add Buck's "bin" directory to your
PATH. Once that's done...

Obtain a list of all available targets

```sh
buck targets
```

Build a particular file:

```sh
buck build //java/client/src/org/openqa/selenium:webdriver-api
```

There are aliases for commonly invoked targets in the `.buckconfig`
file, and these aliases can be invoked directly:

```sh
buck build htmlunit
```

All buck output is stored under "buck-out", with the outputs of build
rules in `buck-out/gen`.

If you are doing a number of incremental builds, then you may want to
use `buckd`, which starts a long-lived buck process to watch outputs
and input files. If you do this, consider using `watchman` too, since
the Java 7 file watcher isn't terribly efficient. This can be cloned
from https://github.com/facebook/watchman

## Requirements

* [Java 6 JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
* `java` and `jar` on the PATH

Although the build system is based on rake it's **strongly advised**
to rely on the version of JRuby in `third_party/` that is invoked by
`go`.  The only developer type who would want to deviate from this is
the “build maintainer” who's experimenting with a JRuby upgrade.

Note that all Selenium Java artefacts are **built with Java 6
(mandatory)**.  Those _will work with any Java >= 6_.

### Optional Requirements

* Python 2.6.x to 2.7 (without this, Python tests will be skipped)

### Internet Explorer Driver

If you plan to compile the
[IE driver](http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/InternetExplorerDriver)
you also need:

* [Visual Studio 2008](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-gb/products/2008-editions)
* 32 and 64 bit cross compilers

The build will work on any platform, but the tests for IE will be skipped
silently, if you are not building on Windows.

## Common Tasks

For an express build of the binaries we release run the following from the
directory containing the `Rakefile`:

```sh
./go clean release
```

All build output is placed under the `build` directory. The output can
be found under `build/dist`.  If an error occurs while running this
task complaining about a missing Albacore gem, the chances are you're
using `rvm`.  If this is the case, switch to the system ruby:

```sh
rvm system
```

Of course, building the entire project can take too long. If you just
want to build a single driver, then you can run one of these targets:

```sh
./go chrome
./go firefox
./go htmlunit
./go ie
./go opera
```

As the build progresses, you'll see it report where the build outputs
are being placed.  Of course, just building isn't enough.  We should
really be able to run the tests too.  Try:

```sh
./go test_chrome
./go test_firefox
./go test_htmlunit
./go test_ie
```

Note that the `test_chrome` target requires that you have the separate
[Chrome Driver](http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver)
binary available on your `PATH`.

To run QtWebDriver tests try:

```sh
./go test_qtwebkit
./go test_wd_native_qt4
./go test_wd_native_qt5
./go test_wd_hybrid_qt4
./go test_wd_hybrid_qt5
./go test_wd_quick1
./go test_wd_quick2
```

These targets require environment variable `qtwebdriver` to contain path
to the separate [QtWebDriver](https://github.com/cisco-open-source/qtwebdriver)
binary. Additional command line arguments to run this binary can be
provided with `qtwebdriverargs` environment variable.

If you are interested in a single language binding, try one of:

```sh
./go test_java
./go test_dotnet
./go test_rb
./go test_javascript
```

To run all the tests just run:

```sh
./go test
```

This will detect your OS and run all the tests that are known to be
stable for every browser that's appropriate to use for all language
bindings.  This can take a healthy amount of time to run.

To run the minimal logical Selenium build:

```sh
./go test_javascript test_java
```

As a side note, **none of the developers** run tests using
[Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/).  It is very unlikely that the build
will work as expected if you try and use it.

## Tour

The code base is generally segmented around the languages used to
write the component.  Selenium makes extensive use of JavaScript, so
let's start there.  Working on the JavaScript is easy.  First of all,
start the development server:

```sh
./go debug-server
```

Now navigate to
[http://localhost:2310/javascript](http://localhost:2310/javascript).
You'll find the contents of the `javascript/` directory being shown.
We use the [Closure
Library](https://developers.google.com/closure/library/) for
developing much of the javascript, so now navigate to
[http://localhost:2310/javascript/atoms/test](http://localhost:2310/javascript/atoms/test).

The tests in this directory are normal HTML files with names ending
with `_test.html`.  Click on one to load the page and run the test. You
can run all the javascript tests using:

```sh
./go test_javascript
```

## Maven POM files

Ignore the [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) POM file present in the
same directory. It is only used for releasing to jars to Maven
Repository (public or local), and is not considered the main build
mechanism.

Here is the [public Selenium Maven
repository](http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/seleniumhq/selenium/).

## Build Output

`./go` only makes a top-level `build` directory.  Outputs are placed
under that relative to the target name. Which is probably best
described with an example.  For the target:

```sh
./go //java/client/src/org/openqa/selenium:selenium-api
```

The output is found under:

```sh
build/java/client/src/org/openqa/selenium/selenium-api.jar
```

If you watch the build, each step should print where its output is
going.  Java test outputs appear in one of two places: either under
`build/test_logs` for [JUnit](http://junit.sourceforge.net/) or in
`build/build_log.xml` for [TestNG](http://testng.org/doc/index.html)
tests.  If you'd like the build to be chattier, just append `log=true`
to the build command line.

# Help with *go*

More general, but basic, help for *go*…

```sh
./go --help
```

Remember, *go* is just a wrapper around
[Rake](http://rake.rubyforge.org/), so you can use the standard
commands such as `rake -T` to get more information about available
targets.

## Maven _per se_

If it is not clear already, Selenium is not built with Maven, it is
built with [Crazy-Fun](http://code.google.com/p/crazy-fun/) though
that is invoked with *go* as outlined above so you do not really have
to learn too much about that.

That said, it is possible to relatively quickly build selenium pieces
for Maven to use. You are only really going to want to do this when
you are testing the cutting-edge of Selenium development (which we
welcome) against your application.  Here is the quickest way to build
and deploy into you local maven repository (`~/.m2/repository`), while
skipping Selenium's own tests.

```sh
./go release
cd maven
mvn clean install
```

This sequence will push some seven or so jars into you local Maven
repository with something like 'selenium-server-2.0-SNAPSHOT.jar' as
the name.
